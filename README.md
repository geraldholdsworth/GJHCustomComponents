# GJHCustomComponents
 A set of custom components and classes for Lazarus:<br>
* TGJHTickBox : RISC OS style tick box<br>
* TGJHRadioBox : RISC OS style radio (option) box<br>
* TGJHSlider : Coloured slider with title and value<br>
* TGJHRegistry : Wrapper around the TRegistry class<br>
<br>
I have written these to serve my own purposes, but are here for others to use. I will likely add to them, and update them over time.<br>
<br>
Utilising these means not having to install packages and recompile Lazarus.
